# YouTube-Playlist-Downloader
Downloads a youtube playlist using pytube in the required quality. The code can be modified to download different quality of videos, or even audios in .mp4 

1. You can change your playlist link on line number 7.
2. Do read the very first line in the code about installing pytube module. The usual way, pytube module is somewhat dysfunctional but @baxterisme has given a nice support. 
3. More information and changes to the script can be made by reading the documentation of pytube on web. Most of them will happen on line number 14.
